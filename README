Using this plugin you can interact with a Mumble server (so called Murmur). You can send messages, kick clients, mute and unmute them.

Here are the commands:
!m_msg <mumble_client> <message>
!m_kick <mumble_client> <reason>
!m_mute <mumble_client>
!m_unmute <mumble_client>

Your mumble server needs to have ICE enabled, not dbus.
See http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Ice for details.
