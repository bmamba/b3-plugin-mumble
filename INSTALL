Needed dependencies
-------------------
Zero Ice is needed to run this plugin

Needed Files
------------
Copy extplugin/cmdlevel.py to your b3 directory b3/extplugin and extplugin/conf/cmdlevel.xml to b3/extplugin/conf/.
Add the following line to b3/conf/b3.xml:
	<plugin config="@b3/extplugins/conf/cmdlevel.xml" name="cmdlevel" priority="12" />
Be aware that the priority is unique in your b3.xml.

Copy the directory Murmur into the b3 directory (the working directory where
you will start the bot).

Configuration
-------------
The endpoint string has to be equal to the endpoint string in murmur.ini. If
the host is not localhost (127.0.0.1), do not forget to set the icesecret in
murmur.ini and mumble.xml to secure your mumble server.

Your mumble server needs to have ICE enabled, not dbus.
See http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Ice for details.
